# Magic number Game!
## Timings
40-60 Minutes
## Summary
This is a sequel to your previous Magic Number Program, Welcome to the MAGIC NUMBER GAME!
This time we'll increase complexity up a notch to use other things such as:
- libraries
- control flow
- conditions
- while loops
Read the user stories.
## Task
The following are the user stories
```
# User story 1 - As a user, I want to be able to guess a number and know if i got it correct or not, so that I can know if I won or not.

# 2 - As a user, I should get feedback if my number is too high or too low so I can adjust my guess.

# 3 - as a user I should only be able to guess 3 times before a new number is generated

# 4 - as a user, I should be able to keep playing until I respond with exit

# 5 - as a user, I should be able to use exit in a sentence and still terminate the program

# extra 6 - as a user, when I terminate the program I should get a message thanking me for playing and the number of times I guesses and number of times I found the number.

# Extra 7 - as a user, I should be asked the highest number that can be used to generate a random number


# self five
```
## Acceptance Criteria
* random number is generate by random library
* all core 5 user stories should be done
* program should **not break** when given strings
* program should use while loop
